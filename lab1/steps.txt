1: Use the mkdir command to create 3 directories, dir(1-3)
2: Use the touch command to create 3 files, file(1-3)
3: Use the cp command to copy each file to the corresponding directory.
4: Use the mv command to rename each file to directoryname_filename.
5: Use rmdir to delete (remove) dir1.  Why did it fail?  Use rm to remove the file in dir 1 then try again.
6: Use rmdir -r to remove dir2 without needing to delete the contents first.
